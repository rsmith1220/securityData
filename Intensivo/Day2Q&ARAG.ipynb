To operate the climate control system, use the buttons and knobs located on the center console.  Temperature: The temperature knob controls the temperature inside the car. Turn the knob clockwise to increase the temperature or counterclockwise to decrease the temperature. Airflow: The airflow knob controls the amount of airflow inside the car. Turn the knob clockwise to increase the airflow or counterclockwise to decrease the airflow. Fan speed: The fan speed knob controls the speed of the fan. Turn the knob clockwise to increase the fan speed or counterclockwise to decrease the fan speed. Mode: The mode button allows you to select the desired mode. The available modes are: Auto: The car will automatically adjust the temperature and airflow to maintain a comfortable level. Cool: The car will blow cool air into the car. Heat: The car will blow warm air into the car. Defrost: The car will blow warm air onto the windshield to defrost it.\"\n",
